## 📌 About the Project

This project focuses on the concept of **state management** in web applications. State refers to the data or properties that determine how a web application behaves at a given time. Understanding how to manage state effectively is key to creating dynamic, responsive web interfaces.

A counter with "+" and "−" buttons that updates the count without going below zero.

### 🔹 Activity 3: Toggling a Section (Visibility State)
Implements a "Show/Hide Info" toggle button that demonstrates state-based visibility control.

### 🔹 Activity 4: Global State Sharing (User Login Simulation)
Simulates a login system with a global `appState` object, updating the header and sidebar with the logged-in user's information.
